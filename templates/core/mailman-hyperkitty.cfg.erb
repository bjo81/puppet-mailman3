# This is the mailman extension configuration file to enable HyperKitty as an
# archiver. Remember to add the following lines in the mailman.cfg file:
#
# [archiver.hyperkitty]
# class: mailman_hyperkitty.Archiver
# enable: yes
# configuration: /path/to/here/mailman-hyperkitty.cfg
#

[general]

# This is your HyperKitty installation, preferably on the localhost. This
# address will be used by Mailman to forward incoming emails to HyperKitty
# for archiving. It does not need to be publicly available, in fact it's
# better if it is not.
base_url: <%= @base_url %>

# This is the public URL of your HyperKitty installation. This value will
# appear as a link at the bottom of emails sent to the list, so it must be
# publicly accessible.
public_url: <%= @public_url %>

# Shared API key, must be the identical to the value in HyperKitty's
# settings.
api_key: <%= @hyperkitty_api_key %>
